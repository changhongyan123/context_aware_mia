This repository contains the official code for the paper "Context-aware Membership Inference Attacks against Pre-trained Models", accepted at the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025).


## Installation

```bash
conda create -n mia python=3.10
conda activate mia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running Individual Scripts

- **`run_baselines.py`**: Run baseline attacks and save results in `results_new` folder
- **`run_ref_baselines.py`**: Run attacks on reference models for preparing reference attack
- **`run_ours_construct_mia_data.py`**: Generate train and test data for our attacks
- **`run_ours_train_lr.py`**: Get all our attack results
- **`run_ours_different_agg.py`**: Get our attack results with p-value combination for different aggregations
- **`run_ours_get_roc.py`**: Get the complete ROC curves for our attacks

### Running All Attacks

- **`run.sh`**: Execute all attacks using the provided bash script
